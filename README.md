The goal of this project is to implement a gradebook that is responsible for various operations. The Gradebook will be a struct containing several elements, most notably an array of GradebookEntry. These GradebookEntries will be where the students’ grades are stored. Each entry will hold one student, the grades for that student, and the student’s overall grade (a weighted average). This mock Georgia Tech ID's for implementation.
